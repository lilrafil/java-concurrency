# Java Concurrency Repository

Welcome to the **Java Concurrency** repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring, understanding, and mastering concurrency in Java through structured content, practical examples, and advanced topics.

## Repository Structure
The repository is divided into two main parts:

### **Part 1: Core Concurrency Concepts**
1. **Synchronization vs Locks**
   - Key differences and use cases.
   - Practical examples of synchronized blocks and locks.

2. **Thread Management**
   - Creating and managing threads.
   - Thread lifecycle and interruption.

3. **Concurrent Collections**
   - Overview of `java.util.concurrent` package collections.
   - Examples and performance considerations.

4. **Atomic Variables and Non-blocking Algorithms**
   - Introduction to atomic classes like `AtomicInteger`.
   - Implementing non-blocking algorithms.

### **Part 2: Advanced Concurrency Topics**
5. **Advanced Locking Mechanisms**
   - Read-write locks, reentrant locks, and stamped locks.
   - Optimizing locking strategies.

6. **CompletableFuture and Asynchronous Programming**
   - Building asynchronous workflows.
   - Error handling and chaining tasks.

7. **Performance Considerations and Tuning**
   - Measuring and improving performance in multithreaded applications.
   - Avoiding common pitfalls.

8. **Advanced Topics (Optional)**
   - Java Memory Model and Happens-Before relationships.
   - Custom synchronizers.
   - Enhancements in recent Java versions.
